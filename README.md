# Azure OpenAI Workshop

## What is Azure OpenAI?

Azure OpenAI is a cloud-based service that provides access to OpenAI's advanced language models such as **GPT-4**, **GPT-3**, **Codex**, and **DALL-E**, with the enterprise readiness of Azure (e.g. private networking, regional availability, content filtering, and role-based access control). Once an Azure OpenAI Service resource is provisioned within an Azure subscription, users can access the service through REST APIs, Python SDK, or a web-based interface known as Azure OpenAI Studio.

## :thinking: Prerequisites

* An [Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) with an active subscription. Note: If you don't have access to an Azure subscription, you may be able to start with a [free account](https://www.azure.com/free).
* You must have the necessary privileges within your Azure subscription to create resources and  perform role assignments.
* Access granted to Azure OpenAI in the desired Azure subscription. Note: You can apply for access to Azure OpenAI by completing the form at [https://aka.ms/oai/access](https://aka.ms/oai/access)
