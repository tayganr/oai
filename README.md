# Azure OpenAI Workshop

## What is Azure OpenAI?

Azure OpenAI is a cloud-based service that provides access to OpenAI's advanced language models such as **GPT-4**, **GPT-3**, and **DALL-E**, with the enterprise readiness of Azure (e.g. private networking, regional availability, content filtering, and role-based access control). Once an Azure OpenAI Service resource is provisioned within an Azure subscription, users can access the service through REST APIs, Python SDK, or a web-based interface known as Azure OpenAI Studio.
